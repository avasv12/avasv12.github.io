This shows a decrease in the use of words like “husband” and “boyfriend” in headlines. For my lookaround, I prefaced the thematic words with “her/a/the/in”. It also shows an increase in the use of words like “lead” and “power” over time. This pattern isn’t perfect and certain years don’t follow this, but for the most part it seems like headlines about men have decreased and headlines about leading and power have increased.\n\n\nShow the code\nby_country &lt;- headlines |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  summarize(boyfriend = sum(str_detect(headline_no_site, \"boyfriend\")),\n            husband = sum(str_detect(headline_no_site, \"husband\")),\n            lead = sum(str_detect(headline_no_site, \"lead\")),\n            power = sum(str_detect(headline_no_site, \"power\"))\n            ) |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(boyfriend, husband, lead, power),\n    names_to = \"theme\",\n    values_to = \"counts\"\n  ) \n\nggplot(by_country, aes(x = country, y = counts, fill = theme)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Country\", \n    y = \"Counts\",\n    fill = \"Thematic words\",\n    title = \"Women in Headlines: Counts of Words by Country\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the counts of each thematic word by country.

The highest category in South Africa is “lead” and the lowest is “boyfriend”. The highest category in India “husband” and the lowest is “boyfriend”."
