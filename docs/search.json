It also shows an increase in the use of words like “lead” and “power” over time.

    "text": "Maternal investment in frogs\nFor this project, I will be looking at the frog dataset from OpenIntro. This data set is from a study which was trying to understand whether maternal investment changes at varying altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau. The study sought to determine whether reproducing females allocated their energy to egg productions of size or number, which can both influence fitness.\nFrom February to April 2013, the study team studied various populations of frog who live between 2035 to 3494 m above sea level in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. They located breeding ponds at various altitudes, and at each one, obtained a small sample of freshly laid egg clutches. They counted the number of eggs and weighed the clutch to determine egg weight, and approximated egg size from photographs. The groups I will be looking at will be those above 2,764.5m and those below. I will compare clutch volume. Original data from Chen et al. (2013).\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nfrog &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/avasantos-volpe/Downloads/frog.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# create altitude groups\nfrog2 &lt;- frog |&gt;\n  mutate(group = ifelse(altitude&gt;=2764.5, \"High\", \"Low\"))\n  \n# summarize variables\nfrog_summary &lt;- frog2 |&gt;\n  group_by(group) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_clutch = mean(clutch.size),\n            med_clutch = median(clutch.size))\n\n# visualize relationship of interest\nggplot(frog2, aes(x = group, y = clutch.size)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# calculate observed statistic\nfrog_summary |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_diff = diff(avg_clutch),\n            med_diff = diff(med_clutch))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  avg_diff med_diff\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     13.7     49.5\n\n\nThis plot is a visualization of the original data. It shows some differences between the “high” and “low” altitude groups, with a couple of outliers. The median for the “high” group is 691.83 m^3, while the median for the “low” group is 741.31 m^3. The average for the “high” group is 719.69 m^3, while the average for the “low” group is 733.42 m^3.\nThe following simulation function takes the original data and permutes the clutch sizes among groups. Next, it calculates the difference in means/medians for the original and permuted data. Then, it compares them. Lastly, I mapped my data so that the function would be repeated many times to build a distribution of what differences we would expect by chance.\n\n\nShow the code\n# generate null sampling distribution\nperm_data &lt;- function(rep, data) {\n  data |&gt;\n    select(group, clutch.size) |&gt;\n    mutate(clutch_perm = sample(clutch.size, replace = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    group_by(group) |&gt;\n    summarize(obs_avg = mean(clutch.size),\n              obs_med = median(clutch.size),\n              perm_avg = mean(clutch_perm),\n              perm_med = median(clutch_perm)) |&gt;\n    summarize(obs_avg_diff = diff(obs_avg),\n              obs_med_diff = diff(obs_med),\n              perm_avg_diff = diff(perm_avg),\n              perm_med_diff = diff(perm_med),\n              rep = rep)\n}\n\nmap(c(1:10), perm_data, data = frog2) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   obs_avg_diff obs_med_diff perm_avg_diff perm_med_diff   rep\n          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1         13.7         49.5         -6.19          32.6     1\n 2         13.7         49.5         49.1           84.4     2\n 3         13.7         49.5         -4.85          16.1     3\n 4         13.7         49.5        -46.7          -31.9     4\n 5         13.7         49.5         51.2           66.7     5\n 6         13.7         49.5         39.9           84.4     6\n 7         13.7         49.5        -23.2          -31.9     7\n 8         13.7         49.5        -25.4          -16.1     8\n 9         13.7         49.5         14.8           66.7     9\n10         13.7         49.5        -34.0          -16.1    10\n\n\nShow the code\n# visualize the null sampling distribution (median)\nset.seed(47)\nperm_stats &lt;- \n  map(c(1:500), perm_data, data = frog2) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nperm_stats |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = perm_avg_diff)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = obs_avg_diff), color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Difference in average clutch size across altitudes (null distribution)\",\n    x = \"Difference in average clutch size across altitudes (m^3)\", \n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is the visualization of the null sampling distribution (median).

There is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis: the average/median clutch size of frogs does not differ across elevations. So, altitude does not seem to have an effect on clutch size."
