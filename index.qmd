Hello! My name is Ava Santos-Volpe and I am a senior at Pomona College in Claremont, CA. Academically, I am interested in using molecular and computational tools to answer ecological and conservation-based questions. Outside of school, I love to hike, snorkel/SCUBA dive, and spend time with friends and family!
